# Agribot
Agribot is the AI engine of the FarmBotika project, a retrieval-augmented, Haystack-powered assistant for agricultural insights, diagnostics, and decision support. It indexes field reports, manuals, sensor logs, and agronomy docs so users can ask natural-language questions and receive precise, sourced answers.
